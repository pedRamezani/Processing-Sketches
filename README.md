# Processing Sketches
Processing Sketches which do various things.

## Force Particle
The particles will fly over the screen and loop around the edges (torus).

**Clicking** will toggle the behaviour of the particle:

1. Green Particles will swarm to the mouse position
2. Red Particles will do the same but will stop once they reach a certain distance
3. *disabled by default* - Blue Particles will chase your current mouse position and teleport to a random location afterwards
4. *disabled by default* - Purple Particles are like the blue particles but they will reset to a certain distance (Manhattan norm) on a square 

## Image Particle
Particles will travel over the screen and leave a trail. All trails form an image of a flamingo. 

Pressing **Arrow Up/Down** will *increase/decrease* the particle size an the resulting image will *lose/gain* resolution.

You can drag an drop with your mouse to clear a rectangular area.

## Rainbow Particle
Particles travel over a fullscreen and will paint a picture of a circular rainbow around the center of the screen.

If you **click** your mouse you can *toggle* the change of the rainbow origin. Moving the mouse will then set the origin to the current mouse position.
